This is a project to do web scraping of the [[https://www.top500.org/][TOP500 list]], which is a list of the
500 most powerful commercially available computers in the world.

The goal of this project is to extract the details of the computers from the
lists presented in the web site as HTML tables and store them in CSV format for
later processing.

* Overview

** The www.top500.org web site structure

The lists are created twice a year (in June and November each year), and the web
site presents each edition of the list split across 5 pages, with 100 entries
each.

Each page has one table with one row per entry. Each row provides these details
about each supercomputer:

  - *Rank*: the order of the supercomputer in that edition of the list
  - *Site*: where is the supercomputer located
  - *System*: name of the system
  - *Cores*: number of compute cores
  - *Rmax*: maximal LINPACK performance achieved (TFlop/s)
  - *Rpeak*: theoretical peak performance (TFlop/s)
  - *Power*: power consumption (kW)

Details of the collected information are available on their [[https://www.top500.org/project/top500_description/][description page]].

** robots.txt

The site has a very tolerant ~robots.txt~ file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ curl https://www.top500.org/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Host: www.top500.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ python3 scrape.py -h
usage: scrape.py [-h]
                 [-y {1993,...,2017}]
                 [-m {6,11}]
                 [-z {1993,...,2017}]
                 [-n {6,11}] [-c COUNT] [-f]
                 [outfile]

positional arguments:
  outfile               Output file (default: top500.csv)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -y {1993,...,2017}, --year {1993,...,2017}
                        Collect from year (default: 2017)
  -m {6,11}, --month {6,11}
                        Collect from month (default: 11)
  -z {1993,...,2017}, --endyear {1993,...,2017}
                        Collect until year (default: 2017)
  -n {6,11}, --endmonth {6,11}
                        Collect until month (default: 11)
  -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                        Number of entries to get from each edition (default:
                        500)
  -f, --force           Force a partial count (default: False)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In summary: if invoked without arguments, ~scrape.py~ will download the whole
list for the latest available edition (at the time of the writing, this is
November 2017; this is calculated at run time), i.e. 500 entries.

You can specify a starting edition with ~--year~ and/or ~--month~, and it will
start from there. It will continue until the latest edition, or you can specify
the last edition to collect with ~--endyear~ and/or ~--endmonth~.

By default it collects all 500 systems for each edition. You can change that
with ~--count~ (this specifies the number of systems to collect /per edition/,
not the total number of entries to collect - which doesn't make that much sense).

Because the lists are hosted in pages of 100 entries each, by default ~--count~
only accepts values in hundreds (100, 200, 300, ...) to make the most of the
downloaded content. You can force partial scraping of downloaded pages with
~--force~ (i.e. if you want to collect just 250 entries per list, specify ~-c
250 -f~; it will still download 300, because that's how the pages are built, but
will only scrape the first 250).

** Dependencies

The scraper has the following dependencies:

  - Python 3
  - The [[http://docs.python-requests.org/][Python Requests]] module is used to download the pages.
  - The [[https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/][Beatuful Soup]] Python module is used to parse the pages.

** Proxy support

The ~requests~ module has built-in [[http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies][proxy support]]. If needed, you can set the
~HTTPS_PROXY~ environment variable pointing to your proxy before running the
scraper:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
HTTPS_PROXY="http://my-proxy.example.com:3128"
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Scraping notes

Some notes about the website structure, to keep in mind during scraping.

** List page

*** Number format

Numbers are written in US format, with commas to separate thousands and dots for
the decimal point.

Conversion is performed using the ~locale~ module, setting locale to
~en_US.UTF-8~ and using the ~atoi~ and ~atof~ functions.

*** Highlights list vs full list

Each edition of the list has a /highlights/ list with the top 10 for that
edition. That list has 6 columns, where the 2nd column contains both the system
and the site mixed in.

The tables with the full list contain 7 columns: the 2nd column contains the
site and the 3rd contains the system.

We scrape only the full lists, as the highlights/summary do not provide any
additional information.

*** System name column structure

In general, a /system/ (3rd column in the list) looks like this in most cases:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <td><a href="https://www.top500.org/system/SYSTEM_ID">
      SYSTEM_NAME, PROCESSOR, INTERCONNECT, COPROCESSORS
  </a><br/>MANUFACTURER</td>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Of these fields, /System Name/ and /Co-processors/ can only be found here
(i.e. in that colum of the listings) - they are not provided in the system's
details page. Well, the title of that page copies the whole lot, including
system name and processors, but the name or co-processors are not listed by
themselves anywhere.

/Interconnect/ and /Processor/ are listed in the system's details page (the
/href/ in that column) and can be properly identified from that other page.
Therefore, an attempt has been made to extract a system's /name/ and
/co-processor/ (stored as /gpu/ in the output) from this column.

However:

 - not all systems provide information about the processors and/or interconnect
   in the listing page. For example, [[https://www.top500.org/system/176928][Tera-100 - Bull bullx super-node
   S6010/S6030]].

 - some systems also include GPU information, like [[https://www.top500.org/system/178467][QB-2 - Dell C8220X Cluster,
   Intel Xeon E5-2680v2 10C 2.8GHz, Infiniband FDR, NVIDIA K20x]]. GPU information
   is not detailed in the system details page.

 - some systems have more than one type of coprocessor, e.g. [[https://www.top500.org/system/178524][Thunder - SGI ICE
   X, Xeon E5-2699v3/E5-2697 v3, Infiniband FDR, NVIDIA Tesla K40, Intel Xeon
   Phi 7120P]]. We bundle all of them together in the /gpu/ field.

 - some systems include GPU information at the beginning of their name,
   e.g. [[https://www.top500.org/system/177996][SANAM - Adtech, ASUS ESC4000/FDR G2, Xeon E5-2650 8C 2.000GHz, Infiniband FDR, AMD FirePro S10000]].

 - some systems have the order of the fields reversed, like [[https://www.top500.org/system/179200][Inspur SA5212H5,
   Xeon E5-2682v4 16C 2.5GHz, NVIDIA Tesla P100, 25G Ethernet]] which lists the
   interconnect after the GPU.

 - some systems mention the co-processor but not the interconnect,
   e.g. [[https://www.top500.org/system/176929][Tianhe-1A - NUDT YH MPP, Xeon X5670 6C 2.93 GHz, NVIDIA 2050]]

 - some systems simply have no specific name, they are just a concatenation of
   e.g. processor + interconnect, like [[https://www.top500.org/system/173259][Pentium4 Xeon 2.4 GHz, Myrinet]]

As a result of all this, parsing of the system entry from the listing to obtain
the /name/ and /gpu/ is actually impossible to do reliably for all the systems
just from the data available in the top500 web site.

Therefore, the code that handles this is "best effort" and the /GPU/ column of
the output has "mixed results". Some additional processing with the help of
specialized data sources (e.g. a database of known co-processors) would improve
that.

 Lacking this, the approach taken was:

  - Remove the known /processor/ and /interconnect/ details from the system's
    description. NOTE: these are not exact matches, and there's quite variety
    here too unfortunately.

  - With the remaining content (if any), try to guess what's the name and what's
    the GPU. After some observations, it seems that the simplest approach to
    take here is to use the first remaining part (delimited by commas) as the
    name and the rest as GPU.

**** Fuzzy comparison notes

~SequenceMatcher~ from ~difflib~ has been used to compare known details with
system descriptions to try to extract the information. It's challenging.

These are supposed to be *equal* (interconnect):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> from difflib import SequenceMatcher as SM
>>> SM(None, 'Custom', 'Custom Interconnect').ratio()
0.48
>>> SM(None, 'Gigabit Ethernet', 'GigEth').ratio()
0.5454545454545454
#+END_EXAMPLE

These should be *different* (system name vs processor):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> SM(None, 'R12000 300MHz', 'ORIGIN 2000 300 MHz').ratio()
0.75
>>> SM(None, 'PowerPC 604e 332MHz', 'SP PC604e 332 MHz').ratio()
0.7777777777777778
>>> SM(None, 'Cray X1E (1 GHz)', 'Cray X1E 2c 1GHz').ratio()
0.8125
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Site name column structure

A site (2nd column in the list) looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <td><a href="https://www.top500.org/site/SITE_ID">SITE_NAME</a><br>COUNTRY</td>
#+END_EXAMPLE

** System details page

*** Power

Several /Power/ values are marked as "(Submitted)", e.g. https://www.top500.org/system/177981.

Some have "(Derived)": https://www.top500.org/system/178751

Many have no value in this field.

*** Some systems evolve over time

Several fields can change on the same system between different editions of the
list, including the system's name, number of cores, Rmax, Rpeak, Power, ...

Examples:
 - https://www.top500.org/system/178192
 - https://www.top500.org/system/177459
 - https://www.top500.org/system/177449

The wesite is a bit inconsistent here: the system details page always lists the
latest version of the content, regardless of its history.

The scraper keeps the same values that the lists show, overriding system details
with the values from the lists on each edition, to avoid the inconsistency as
much as possible.

* Collected dataset

The attached dataset is the full collection of TOP500 lists, i.e. starting
from the first available list from June 1993. It was collected like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ time python3 -u scrape.py --year 1993 --month 6 > scraping.log

real	45m39,544s
user	9m23,815s
sys	0m2,897s
#+END_EXAMPLE

While adding the dataset in the repo, [[https://github.com/codificat/top500/issues/2][a problem]] was detected:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
fatal: LF reempla√ßaria CRLF en data/top500.csv.
#+END_EXAMPLE

it turns out that the way ~argparse~ opens the output file is not quite what
~csv.write~ handles best, and the resulting output file used CRLF for line ends.
This was manually corrected in the file.
